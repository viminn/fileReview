# Transcriptr

For my honors capstone in Fall 2024, this project parses student transcripts and outputs the information into a .csv file.

This project was made for the Honors Program to help with one of their business processes that takes a lot of time and effort.

## Build from source
Compile an exe from source on Linux with "wine python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=pdfplumber transcriptr.py"
