all about generalizing the process

Getting the text from the pdf is all as one string with newlines. Can't split on newline because it puts "Campus" and "Honors" on the next line

replace \nHonors with Honors to join it?

POL 030 is just 30 that's cool

Honors is not always in the last thing in the string

Grades and Course names can be joined and tough to parse out like "Project in CSCA" since C is also a valid grade

Keep it modular

Use something like Electron or tauri to develop across OS instead of native toolkits

Easy debugging familiarity with JS 


1. get text into string
2. get courses split into a List
3. keep "HONORS" when it's on a newline
4. get the student's name
5. get the term
